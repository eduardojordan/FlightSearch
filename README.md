## Architecture Development and Decision Process

The default architecture is in MVC with the idea of scaling it in MVVC if development requires it. Codables Swift was used to manage the data models. The option of creating resources such as the format of dates to display and some other useful option is left for further development. Storyboars are used in your visual layer, including some adjustments to the root of the code. Insomnia similar to Postman is used for Api checks and SourceTree is used to commit to github.
As for libraries, it was only developed with the ones offered by apple, Foundation, UIkit and a dependency manager (Cocoapods FSCalendar) was included which offers a graphical calendar view to select the date.
